I’ll need access to all the credentials and setup information for our WhatsApp Business API (via 360dialog or Twilio, depending on which one we’re using).

Could you please share the following details:

API Provider — confirm whether we’re using 360dialog or Twilio.

API Base URL (e.g. https://waba.360dialog.io or Twilio endpoint).

WhatsApp Business Account ID

Phone Number ID and the connected WhatsApp number

Permanent Access Token / API Key (with send-message and webhook permissions)

Verify Token (for webhook verification handshake)

Webhook URL currently registered (if any) — and confirm whether I can change or add one for testing.

Test environment or sandbox phone number (if available).

If you already have the Meta App or Twilio console access, please also add me (or share credentials securely) so I can view message templates, webhooks, and logs.

Once I have these details, I’ll set up the webhook listener and start implementing the message flows (verification, calendar updates, and confirmations).
